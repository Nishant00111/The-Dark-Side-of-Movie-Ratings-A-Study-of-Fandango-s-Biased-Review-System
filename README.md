## Are Fandango Movie Ratings Misleading Moviegoers ? An Examination of Review Inflation....
This project focuses on analyzing movie reviews provided by Fandango company. The data used in this project includes over 14,000 movie reviews and ratings. The main objective of the project is to understand the distribution of movie ratings provided by Fandango and investigate whether Fandango's movie ratings were biased or not.

### Data Source
The data for this project was collected from Fandango's website and was originally scraped by a data journalist named Walt Hickey. The dataset includes information on over 14,000 movies, such as movie titles, user ratings, and critic ratings. We preprocessed the data by removing any duplicates, outliers, and missing values.

### Methodology
We used various Python libraries to analyze the data, including:

#### pandas: used for data manipulation and preprocessing
#### numpy: used for numerical calculations and data analysis
#### matplotlib.pyplot: used for data visualization and creating charts and graphs
#### seaborn: used for data visualization and creating more advanced charts and graphs
#### scipy: used for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
We used descriptive statistics to analyze the distribution of movie ratings provided by Fandango. We calculated the mean, median, and mode of the ratings, as well as the frequency distribution of ratings. We also compared Fandango's ratings to other movie rating platforms such as IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic.

To investigate whether Fandango's ratings were biased or not, we used hypothesis testing. We compared the distribution of Fandango's ratings to the distribution of ratings from other platforms and found that Fandango's ratings were indeed inflated compared to other platforms. We also analyzed the difference between Fandango's user ratings and critic ratings and found that there was a significant difference between the two, with user ratings being consistently higher.

### Results
Our analysis showed that Fandango's movie ratings were biased and inflated compared to other movie rating platforms. We found that Fandango consistently gave higher ratings to movies, which can mislead moviegoers and affect their decision-making. We also found that Fandango's user ratings were consistently higher than critic ratings, which suggests that Fandango may prioritize positive user ratings to attract more customers.

### Limitations and Future Work
One limitation of our project is that the data was collected in 2015, and Fandango may have made changes to their rating system since then. In future work, we could collect more recent data and compare our findings. We could also analyze the impact of Fandango's biased ratings on movie revenue and audience perception.

### Usage
The findings of our project can help moviegoers make more informed decisions when choosing which movies to watch. It also highlights the importance of unbiased and accurate movie ratings. We hope that our project can contribute to the field of data analysis and have a positive impact on the movie industry.

### Conclusion
Our movie review analysis for Fandango company provides valuable insights into the distribution of movie ratings and the potential bias of Fandango's rating system. We hope that our work can contribute to improving the accuracy and transparency of movie ratings and help moviegoers make more informed decisions.
